title: "Set up on Mac OS"

This mod has been recently ported to MacOS, and all features should be supported. However, you must grant the accessibility permission to Minecraft for mouse simulation to work.

1. Launch Minecraft with the mod and enter a world
2. Press left bracket to trigger a mouse click
3. After you hear a message saying that the accessibility permission has not been granted, open System Settings
4. Choose Privacy & Security in the sidebar
5. Select Accessibility in the scroll area on the right
6. Find Minecraft (or your third-party launcher if you use one) in the list and turn it on
7. Enter your password when prompted
8. Restart Minecraft, and everything should work

## Changing Speech Settings

To change the voice, pitch, and volume the mod uses, open System Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content, and change the settings there. Changing your default speech rate will not affect Minecraft Access, so you must change that from the configuration menu.

1. Open Minecraft and enter a world
2. Press F4 followed by 0 to open the config menu
3. Tab to "Speech Settings Configs" and press enter
4. Press enter on "Speech Rate (percent)"
5. Type in a new percentage and press enter
6. Exit the config menu by pressing escape two times
