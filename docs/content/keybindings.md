# Minecraft Access Keybindings

This page contains all the keybindings added by the mod.

You can change these keybindings in the settings (open `Options...` then `Controls..` then `Key Binds..`), all keybinding setting groups that are provided by this mod have a `Minecraft Access:` prefix to differentiate them from the original keybinding settings.

You may find that some features have duplicate keys, such as I, J, K, L as the arrow keys in various features.
It's ok since the same key takes effect in different interfaces for different functions.

You may want to take a look at [all the original controls](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Controls#Java_Edition) as well.
