* Add [Sound Cue Listening Page]({{% relref "/sounds" %}}) for making users refer to the sound cue they heard in the game.

Release v1.5.3 (2024-02)
---------------------------

### Feature Changes

* Now the Read Crosshair feature will only play the position sound cue once when player looks at different sides of same block.
* When locking on an entity, POI Locking feature will always try to target at a valid position that you can interact with, thus you can attack a monster even it expose small part of its body to you.
* Now POI Locking feature will never let you make eye contact with an [Enderman](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enderman).
* [Boat](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Boat), [mine cart](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecart), [slime](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Slime), [magma cube](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Magma_cube), and [ancient debris](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ancient_debris) can be scanned and locked with POI feature now. [#157](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/157) [#203](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/203) [#215](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/215)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix the bug that looking at fluid will make Read Crosshair spam. [#262](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/262)

Release v1.5.2 (2024-01)
---------------------------

### Bug Fixes

* Fix the bug that locking on Entity will immediately unlock [#248](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/248)

* Fix the bug that speaking recipes in Inventory Screen will cause the game crush. [#251](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/251)

### Refactoring, Documentation and Chores

Now there are [three workflows](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/blob/1.21/.github/workflows):

* `test`: Triggered by PR, runs tests suite
* `build`: Manually triggered, builds mod files, you can download built files from action page
* `publish`: Manually triggered, creates GitHub release, publish mod files to Modrinth and CurseForge

For running `release` workflow, the repo must have `MODRINTH_TOKEN` and `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN` in repo's secret settings.
For running `build` workflow to build previous version of mod, [lang repo](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access-i18n) must have same version tag (git tag) as target build version.

Release v1.5.1 (2024-01)
---------------------------

### Feature Changes

* Add a new config `Speak Focused Slot Changes` with default `true` value for `Inventory Controls` feature. Close this config if you hear the mod is continuously repeating changes of item name. [#242](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft_access/issues/242)

Release v1.5.0 (2024-01)
---------------------------

### Feature Changes

* Breaking change: The mod will speak `unlock` on every unlock (used to be only on manually press unlock key). Config `Play Unlocking Sound` is replaced by [`Play Sound Instead Of Speak`]({{% relref "/config#entitiesblocks-locking" %}}), default value is `false`, so if you find out speak is annoying, switch this config to `ture` for original base drum sound.

### Refactoring, Documentation and Chores

* Add [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/) (1.18.30) as `common` module dependency.
* Use lombok's `@Slf4j` instead of `MainClass.debug()` to let every class has its own logger.
* Change some log message's level to `DEBUG`, make these logs controlled by config `Debug Mode` (and tested in dev and prod environments).
* Use lombok's `@Getter` `@Setter` to replace `*ConfigMap`'s boilerplate code.

To developers: Please remove `.idea/runConfigurations` directory (which generated by `architectury-plugin`?) and refresh gradle project to let architectury to generate new `IntelliJ Run/Debug Configurations`, or starting `:forge:client` with resalt in an Exception: `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: cpw.mods.bootstraplauncher.BootstrapLauncher`.

### Dependencies Changes

* minecraft_version: `1.20.1` -> `1.20.4`
* architectury_version: `9.0.8` -> `11.0.9`
* fabric_loader_version: `0.14.21` -> `0.15.1`
* fabric_api_version: `0.84.0+1.20.1` -> `0.93.1+1.20.4`
* forge_version: `1.20.1-47.0.19` -> `1.20.4-49.0.19`

Release v1.4.0 (2023-11)
---------------------------

### New Features

#### Speak Text Editing

* Now the mod will simulate the feedback you get when typing text in other software's input boxes, it will speak the text that you delete, select, pass with cursor, on Chat Screen, Book Edit Screen, Command Block Screen and so on.
* Suppress annoying original `speak whole sentence` narration on every text editing operation.
* Simplify the original command suggestion narration for a better typing experience with lesser annoying too-detailed narrations.

See also: [description of this feature]({{% relref "/features#speak-text-editing" %}}) [#187](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/187)

#### I18N Fallback Mechanism

A fallback mechanism is added to I18n in case it fails on unsupported languages, or text that not translated in time in supported languages.
If any I18N failed on your language, the mod will use the English version instead.
Set the game to your familiar language is recommended, even if it's not supported by this mod, since you can still be benefited from translatable game original text, such as name of blocks or creatures.
If you want to contribute to translating work, we manage the translation of this mod in [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access-i18n#minecraft-access-i18n), take a look.

### Feature Changes

* Now whenever you're looking at a block and entity, the mod will play a piano sound cue to indicate relative location between you and target. see also: [description of this feature]({{% relref "/features#relative-position-sound-cue" %}}) [#191](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/191)
* Now the mod will only speak item count when held item type isn't changed (when picking up or spending items), with a new config `Report Held Items Count When Changed`, see the [configuration]({{% relref "/config#other-configurations" %}}).
* Now the mod will speak sitting state of cat, dog, parrot, [and so on](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sitting#Mechanics) in `Read Crosshair`. [#192](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/192)
* Not the mod will speak if an animal is tamed in `Read Crosshair`.
* Now the mod can tell if a zombie villager is under curing in `Read Crosshair`. [#195](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/195)
* Now the mod will additionally speak an entity's type if it has a custom name given by the name tag.
* Move `Shearable` word in front of sheep information in `Read Crosshair`.
* Now the mod will tell if your [taming operation](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Taming) is successful or not.
* The default value of config `Disable Speaking Consecutive Blocks With Same Name` in feature `Read Crosshair` is changed from `true` to `false`, to help newcomers understanding the game better.

---------------------------

### New Features

* Simplified Chinese translations (thanks to @onion108 for this).
* Fall detector is back but in this version instead of speaking `warning fall detected`, a sound is played at block (Anvil Block Hit sound to be specific). Do let me know if you think that previous implementation was better :)

## Changes and Fixes

* Chat Message Reader, now you can use alt + number keys to speak last 9 chat messages (this atm does not include any system sent messages).
* Added config to disable speaking action bar updates.
* Added sculk sensor/catalyst/shrieker to poi blocks

Release 1.0.0 (for 1.19.3) (2023-02-05)
---------------------------

This marks the release of Minecraft Access. All the features from the previous mods have been implemented to this mod (except fall detector). Some have been changed or improved. Here are some noticeable changes:

### Noticeable Changes

* The mod now works with both fabric and forge now.
* The mod now uses [Tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library for accessing screen reader in Windows and [libSpeechdWrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper) for Linux.
* Inventory controls key mapping is changed and now supports all the menus (including creative inventory)
* Key mappings for camera controls have also been updated to better suit keyboard with no numpad/keypad.
* The feature that reads the crosshair target also gives additional information like whether a block is being powered by a redstone source, a door is open or closed, sheep's color, etc.
* The narrator menu now has a few more options including time of day which now works for servers/multiplayer also.
* There is no longer a dedicated menu for mod customization, instead we have to manually edit the config.json file. (more on this [here](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access#mod-configuration))
