# Using the Visually Impaired Access Modpack

This modpack is a community project created by [@BrailleBennett](https://github.com/BrailleBennett).
It was made for the Fabric mod loader for usage on the client side only.
Here is a link to its [official Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vi-access),
where you can read more about it.

## Optional Screenreader

You may want to make use of a screenreader, such as one of these:
1. [NVDA](https://nvaccess.org/) (free and open source)
2. [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (requires payment, not open source)
The modpack will work fine without a screenreader if you don't need one, but some words on the screen won't be read out to you, such as the names of blocks you are looking at. Using a screenreader is recommended for those with very limited vision who cannot read words on the screen easily.

## Installing the Modpack

To install the Visually Impaired Access modpack, you're going to want to install the [Modrinth launcher app](https://modrinth.com/app)

1. Install the Modrinth Launcher: After downloading the launcher from the provided link, follow the installation prompts.
2. Sign in to Minecraft: Once the launcher is installed, sign in to your Microsoft account. This step is necessary to verify that you own the game and to allow the launcher to download game files for you.
3. Find the modpacks Tab: After signing in, navigate to the `Modpacks` tab in the launcher.
4. Search for the Pack: Use the search function to look for `vi-access` or a similar term. You should see `Visually Impaired Access Mods - Fabric` by `BrailleBennett` as the top result.
5. Install the Pack: Click on the `Visually Impaired Access Mods - Fabric` pack and find the `Install` button. Click `Install` to add the mod pack to your library.
6. Go to Your Library: Navigate back to the “Library” tab, which is located at the top of the launcher interface.
7. Find the Installed Pack: In your library, look for the entry labeled `Visually Impaired Access Mods - Fabric` followed by `Fabric <game version>`. This entry should be near the bottom of your library screen.
   A good trick to finding it is to navigate by links using your screen reader until there are no more links and then arrow down a few times.
8. Launch the Game: Once you’ve located the pack, click on it, then press the `Play` button to start the installation and launch the game.

## Updating the Modpack

1. Click on the installation of the modpack in your library.
2. Find the `Update Pack` button on the same screen as the `Play` button.
3. Look for the heading that says `Select Pack Version`.
4. Find the top version number in the list.
5. Click the button to the left of the top version number to apply it.
6. Refresh the page.
7. You're good to go!
