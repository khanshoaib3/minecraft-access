# Minecraft Access

Minecraft Access is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) mod that specifically helps visually impaired players play Minecraft.
It is an integration and replacement for [a series of previous mods](https://github.com/accessible-minecraft).
This mod primarily borrows the help of a screen reader to describe (narrate) the game interface, and incorporates sound cues to provide orientation perception in this 3D world.
Currently, this mod [has enough features](docs/faq.md#is-the-mod-enough-to-play-the-game-normally) to help visually impaired players play the game normally.

This mod supports:

* Game version `1.21`, `1.20.6`, `1.20.4`, `1.20.1`, `1.19.3`
* On [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and [NeoForge](https://fneoforged.net) mod loaders
* On Windows and Linux operating systems ([Help us port the mod to macOS](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/22))
* Works despite the language setting of the game (though the mod specific narration will [fall back to English](/docs/features.md#i18n-fallback-mechanism) if the mod does not support the language yet)

Each version of this mod will be pre-released on [GitHub](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/releases) and announced in the [Playability Discord server](https://discord.gg/yQjjsDqWQX) first as a beta testing stage, after one week of feedback collection, the version will be released on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-access/versions) and [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blind-accessibility/files).
