# Minecraft Access

Minecraft Access is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) mod that specifically helps visually impaired players play Minecraft.
It is an integration and replacement for [a series of previous mods](https://github.com/accessible-minecraft).
This mod primarily borrows the help of a screen reader to describe (narrate) the game interface, and incorporates sound cues to provide orientation perception in this 3D world.
Currently, this mod [has enough features](doc/FAQ.md#is-the-mod-enough-to-play-the-game-normally) to help the visually impaired people play the game normally.

This mod supports:

* Game version `1.19.3`, `1.20.1`.
* On [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) modding platform
* On Windows and Linux operating system ([Help us on macOS porting](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/22))
