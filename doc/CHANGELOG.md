Release v1.4.0 (2023-11)
---------------------------

### New Features

#### Speak Text Editing

* Now the mod will simulate the feedback you get when typing text in other software's input boxes, it will speak the text that you delete, select, pass with cursor, on Chat Screen, Book Edit Screen, Command Block Screen and so on.
* Suppress annoying original "speak whole sentence" narration on every text editing operation.
* Simplify the original command suggestion narration for a better typing experience with lesser annoying too-detailed narrations.

See also: [description of this feature](/doc/FEATURES.md#speak-text-editing) [#187](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/187)

#### I18N Fallback Mechanism

A fallback mechanism is added to I18n in case it fails on unsupported languages, or text that not translated in time in supported languages.
If any I18N failed on your language, the mod will use the English version instead.
Set the game to your familiar language is recommended, even if it's not supported by this mod, since you can still be benefited from translatable game original text, such as name of blocks or creatures.
If you want to contribute to translating work, we manage the translation of this mod in [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access-i18n#minecraft-access-i18n), take a look.

### Feature Changes

* Now whenever you're looking at a block and entity, the mod will play a piano sound cue to indicate relative location between you and target. see also: [description of this feature](/doc/FEATURES.md#relative-position-sound-cue) [#191](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/issues/191)

Release 1.0.0 (for 1.19.3) (2023-02-05)
---------------------------

This marks the release of Minecraft Access. All the features from the previous mods have been implemented to this mod (except fall detector). Some have been changed or improved. Here are some noticeable changes:

### Noticeable Changes

- The mod now works with both fabric and forge now.
- The mod now uses [Tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library for accessing screen reader in Windows and [libSpeechdWrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper) for Linux.
- Inventory controls key mapping is changed and now supports all the menus (including creative inventory)
- Key mappings for camera controls have also been updated to better suit keyboard with no numpad/keypad.
- The feature that reads the crosshair target also gives additional information like whether a block is being powered by a redstone source, a door is open or closed, sheep's color, etc.
- The narrator menu now has a few more options including time of day which now works for servers/multiplayer also.
- There is no longer a dedicated menu for mod customization, instead we have to manually edit the config.json file. (more on this [here](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access#mod-configuration))
