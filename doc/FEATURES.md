## Camera Controls

This feature allows you to control the camera (your in-game facing direction and crosshair) through the keyboard.
The mod will automatically report the current direction as the camera moves, such as "North" "South East" "Up" "Down" "Straight".

See also: [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#camera-controls), [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#camera-controls)

## Mouse Simulation

This feature allows you to simulate five mouse operations (left middle right click, scroll up and down) through the keyboard, while keep original mouse input still working.
This feature supports continuous key pressing, e.g. destroying a block requires continuous press of the left mouse button against that block.

You MUST keep the vanilla `Attack/Destroy` key, `Use Item/Place Block` key and `Pick Block` key remain on default mouse keys. This feature will only simulate mouse operations, not directly execute the attack or place operation, it needs mouse key bindings as a medium.

See also: [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#mouse-simulation), [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#mouse-simulation)

## Read Crosshair

This mod will automatically speak the information of the block and entity (i.e., living creatures and moving objects) you are targeting with your crosshair (i.e., what you're looking at).
The crosshair is in the center of the screen.
This mod has no corresponding keybinding.

Additionally, if you're looking at a block, the mod will speak which side of that block you are looking at, it's useful for recognizing directions and placing blocks accurately.
For simple targets, the mod will only speak the name (and side if it's a block), such as "Pig", "Cow", "Grass Block Up", "Stone North".
For functional blocks or entities with multiple forms, the mod will also speak current state of the block, such as "Ripe Wheat Crops Up", "White Sheep Shearable", "Opened Oak Door South", "Powered Dispenser West Facing East".

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#read-crosshair)

### Partial Speaking

Let the mod only (or only not) speak entities/blocks that you've configured. This feature can be easily misused, so it is not enabled by default. A user said that she didn't want to hear the grass block anymore, this feature is the solution to her problem once and for all.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#partial-speaking)

## Inventory Controls

This feature allows you to operate various screens using the keyboard instead of the mouse.
In fact this is a feature makes almost all screens accessible, not just for the inventory screen.
The vast majority of screens contain operations for transferring and using items, so it's appropriate to call this feature `Inventory Controls`.

We divide the various parts of screens into different slot groups, following the original design of screens.
One slot group contains one to more slots, arranged in a grid shape, each of which may be empty or contain one type of items (one stack at max).
You can switch focusing group, move to different slots within a group, or pick up items from slots in one group and place them into slots in another group (to transfer or use them).

Use mouse simulation keys in [`Mouse Simulation`](#mouse-simulation) feature to preform operations such as item transferring and button clicking.
Left mouse key will pick up and put down full number of items in the slot.
Right mouse key will pick up half number of items or put one item down.
Middle mouse key can be used in creative mode to pick up a full stack of item from the item list.
The mod will speak what is currently in the slot, such as "Empty Slot" or "64 Stone".
When you pick up full number of items in a slot, the mod will speak "Empty Slot" to represent current state of the slot.
When you put down grabbing items in a occupied slot, items in the slot will switch with what in your hand, now you're grabbing the items originally in that slot.

Please note that:

1. Item speaking in "Scrollable Recipes Group" under "Crafting Screen" will be delayed about one second, please wait after press the slot moving key to hear the item name.

2. In "Scrollable Recipes Group" under "Crafting Screen", except the first page, sometimes you will hear nothing while you moving between slots. It's best to keep items you want to craft within the first page of the recipe book by moving unused resource items out of your inventory.

## Point of Interest

This feature will scan and notify (with sound cues) you of (pre-configured) special blocks and all types of entity around you.

What blocks are considered special? Those you tend to miss.
In Minecraft, not every block takes up the entire space of a block.
Buttons are tiny and ladders is only a thin layer attached to the wall.
You'll find it difficult to point precisely at these blocks.
Precious blocks like raw ores can be seen at a glance by sighted players, but visually impaired players will need to point at them to know their existence.

By the same token, entities are movable, so scanning and locking onto them helps you get close to and interact with them.

### POI Locking

You can lock onto the closest target with a key, then your camera will follow the target as it moves, so you can approach it more easily.
For example when you want to mine an ore, capture an animal or fight a monster.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#entitiesblocks-locking), [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#point-of-interest)

### POI Marking

Sometimes you may need to search for a special type of block or entity that is not in the pre-configured list, here is the feature you want.
You can mark one type while you are pointing at one of them (with your crosshair).
You can set the mod to only scan and notify on marked type, suppress scanning and notifying on pre-configured ones.

## Fall Detector

This feature alerts you with a sound cue when you're near the edge of a big drop.
It will play a sound effect at every location meets the set threshold, the louder the sound, the closer you are to the edge.

| Sound Cue                   | Description                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Position with high drop-off | [Breaking the Anvil](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Generic), same sound as destroying blocks, like the sound of footstep |

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#fall-detector)

## Narrator Menu

We also call it the `F4 Menu` because it requires pressing the `F4` key to open.
This menu integrates a number of helper functions, and you can execute them by opening the menu or by using the hotkey directly.

| Function                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Player Status

Some features that help you understand the status of the character you control.

### Position Narrator

Minecraft has a built-in [absolute coordinate system](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates), x-axis for the longitude, z for the latitude, and y for the elevation. This feature provides keystrokes to read out coordinates.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#position-narrator), [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#position-narrator)

### Health n Hunger

This feature adds a key to speak your health and hunger.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#health-n-hunger), [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#health-n-hunger)

### Player Warnings

This feature warns you when your [health](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Health), [hunger](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hunger) and [air](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage#Drowning) (when you're submerged in water) below the set thresholds.
You'll hear something like "Warning, Health is {current health}".
If you enable the `Play Sound` config, you'll also hear a sound cue along with the warning words.
You may want to learn about [the various damage types](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage) in the game.

| Sound Cue                  | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Status reach the threshold | [Anvil landing](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Unique), crisp metallic sound |

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#player-warnings)

## Book Editing

The [Book Editing Screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Book_and_Quill#Writing) is a special screen that has nothing to do with item management thus has no slot group.
We've added some not re-mappable keys and narration cues to make it 100% accessible.
This section as a brief guide on how to use this screen, listing the keys corresponding to the functions.

See also: [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#book-editing)

## Speak Text Editing

The mod will simulate the feedback you get when typing text in other software's input boxes.
It will speak the text that you delete, select, pass with cursor on [Chat Screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Chat), [Book Edit Screen](#book-editing), [Command Block Screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Command_Block#Modification) and so on.
Note that we have to speak whole unfinished book title while signing a book since you can't move the cursor in that state, which means that the cursor will stay at the end of title and ignoring your cursor moving operations.

The mod also simplifies the original [command](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands) suggestion narration for a better typing experience with lesser annoying too-detailed narrations.
The content of one command suggestion narration will be like "{the order of focused suggestion}x{total number of suggestions} {suggestion} selected", the format can be customized in the config.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#other-configurations)

## Other Small Features

Some small features that are automatically triggered based on your actions.

See also: [Configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#other-configurations)

### Speak Held Item

When you switch held items, speak the name and number of items in your hand (main hand only).
The item [durability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Durability) information is included.
If you feel that continuous item count reporting is annoying, you can close it in the [configuration](/doc/CONFIG.md#other-configurations).

### Biome Indicator

Speak the name of the [biome](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome) when you're entering one.

### XP Indicator

Speak when your [experience](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Experience) level is increased or decreased.

### Speak Harvest Of Fishing

In fact this feature will speak the items you pick up while you're holding the rod, whether you're actually fishing or not.

### Speak Chat Messages

Speak [chat](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Chat) messages, so you won't miss your friends' conversation.
If you feel that too many chat messages are making you feel noisy, you can turn off showing chat messages in the original `Chat Settings...` options, or press "P" to open [Social Interactions Screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Social_interactions) to mute particular players.

See also: [Keybindings](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#speak-chat-messages)

### Speak Action Bar Updates

Messages updated by the [action bar](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/title) are common in modded multiplayer servers, usually they are used as announcements.
