## Quality of Life Mods

Here are some mods that can improve your game experience.
There are guides about [installing](/doc/SET_UP_ON_WINDOWS.md#install-mods) and [upgrading](/doc/SET_UP_ON_WINDOWS.md#upgrade-the-game-and-mods) mods.

1. Client side, which you can use in both single-player and multiplayer game:
    * Presence Footsteps ([Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps), [Forge port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps-forge)): Footstep sound enhancement mod. If the Fabric version of mod isn't work, select `Default sound pack` in the resource pack menu. If the mod has not supported your game version, you would consider to use this resource pack
      instead: [Presence Footsteps: Remastered Sounds Pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/presense-footsteps-sounds), put it under `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks` folder.
    * Just Enough Items ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)): Item and recipe viewing mod, far better than similar recipe book feature in original game (but this mod hasn't been 100% accessible by us, you need some vision to use it).
    * Sound Physics Remastered ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)): Provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks. I'm sure this mod consumes resources, so install it only when you're confident in your PC hardware.
    * Jade ([Fabric, Forge, NeoForge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)): Shows information about what you are looking at.

2. Server side, which you can only use in single-player game (unless the multiplayer server admins add them into the server):
    * Tree Harvester ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/tree-harvester)): Harvest trees and huge mushrooms instantly with an axe. It's a common scenario in Minecraft that you can't reach the logs and leaves at higher place when standing on the ground, with this mod, you won't bother yourself with stepping yourself up.
    * Carry On ([Fabric and Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/carry-on)): Allowing players to pick up, carry, and place some blocks (such as Chests) and animals without breaking blocks or guiding animals with a leash.
    * FTB Ultimine ([Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-fabric), [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-forge)): This mod can makes you operate on same type blocks around you by operating only once, like harvest crops, mining a vein and chopping trees.
    * Simple Voice Chat ([Fabric, Forge, NeoForge](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat): A proximity voice chat for Minecraft.

## Tutorial Resources

### General Minecraft tutorials

These resources teach you how to play Minecraft, but lack of detail about game controlling since they are playing without this mod.
My suggestion is learning how to use of this mod first, then learning how to play the game.
Minecraft has a long history since 2009 and there are many tutorials about it, almost every question already had been answered several times on the Internet.
But due to same reason, there are lots of outdated information about this game, keep in mind add game verion as keyword while searching.

* Wiki website in multiple languages, continually updated: [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki) by hardworking volunteers. Has details and guides on everything about Minecraft, it also has [many text tutorials](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials) on it.
* Tutorial video series on YouTube in English, last updated 2024-06-21: [Minecraft Survival Guide (Season 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfpHTJsn9I4&list=PLgENJ0iY3XBjmydGuzYTtDwfxuR6lN8KC) by [Pixlriffs](https://www.youtube.com/@Pixlriffs). A tutorial series on survival mode in Minecraft 1.20 (and later in 1.21), includes lots of topics.

For a specific question, you can:

* Ask AI, no kidding, AI + search engine platforms like [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Bing AI](https://www.bing.com/chat) and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) do know much about Minecraft since they are fed with huge amount of knowledge about it.
* Read corresponding [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/) page, wiki describes every detail of a topic, you may find it's too lengthy.
* Traditional way, search on search engines.

## A Very Simple Beginner Guide

Hi, I'm Boholder, a player and mod developer of Minecraft.
First of all, I'm sighted, but that didn't stop me from being bored by this game the first time I played it.
I didn't know how to play it, except to break and collect blocks, rise myself very high by stacking blocks underneath me then jumping off to die, and to be attacked by monsters to die when it comes to night.
Boring, and a bit of scaring because there are monsters at night, this is my first impression of Minecraft.

One day I accidentally discovered a Minecraft forum when I was surfing the web, and the interesting posts on this forum made me realise that this game wasn't that simple.
I followed the posts, tutorials to learn to play this game, read every page of the wiki site, and play the game in single player mode.
This game became my favorite game.
Later I decided it was too lonely to play alone, I started playing in servers, posted in forums, attending events, made quite a few friends (some of whom I'm still in touch with).
One of the reasons I chose to major in software engineering was because I wanted to write mods for this game, this game has really impacted my life.
I hope I can share some joy of Minecraft with you through this mod.
Ok, enough nonsense, so... where do we start?

### Create a Good World

You can learn this part with the following resources:

* [The TrueBlindCraft Guide::Episode 1: navigating your world and finding your first Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdDpLoCuWBs&list=PLXcBFfRlLcpiDpULQB3L2aX-AQb4-Atbq&index=1)
* [Minecraft Wiki Tutorial: Menu screen](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Menu_screen)

Because Minecraft's world generation is randomized, you may run into the difficulty of trying to generate multiple worlds but all of their spawn location are bad. You can search good [world generation seeds](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Seed_(level_generation)) [on Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=minecraft+good+seed) and set them when you're creating single player worlds.
I highly recommend you lower the difficulty of the game to get better experience, such as change the [difficulty](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Difficulty) to `Peaceful` to avoid monster spawning.

### Game Control

You can learn this part with the following resources:

* [The TrueBlindCraft Guide::Episode 3: Controls for MineCraft and the MineCraft-Access Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPERR_oYzn8&list=PLXcBFfRlLcpiDpULQB3L2aX-AQb4-Atbq&index=3).
* [Minecraft Wiki Tutorial: Beginner's guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Beginner%27s_guide)

Minecraft is a [first-person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_(video_games)) 3D game, its control design is similar to other first-person games, you need to control your in-game character with keyboard AND mouse (don't worry, this mod provides pure keyboard controlling replacement).
If you have some usable vision and can see the game screen (can distinguish the individual blocks that make up the world), it is recommended to play with keyboard and mouse.
If you are unable to see the game screen, it is recommended to use a full-size keyboard which has the numeric keypad on the right.

You can move around with [W A S D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys#WASD_keys), jump with space, crouch with ctrl, sprint with shift (these are default keybindings).
A first-person game means the game screen shows from the viewpoint of your in-game character's eyes.
You can rotate character's view (or "camera", in industry term) smoothly with mouse.
The term of this mouse controlling system is [Free look (also known as mouselook)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_look).
This type of control might be unfamiliar to you if you haven't played similar games before, it's sort of like controlling a tank, moving and looking is separated as two operations, your can operate them at same time.
The direction you're facing is your "front", so if you want to go back, turn your head 180 degrees to look back then press W to move forward, or press S to move backward while you still looking at front.

You can "target at" (adjust view with mouse until the target is at the center of the view) things you're interested in and interact with mouse click.
Some operations require continually pressing keys, like pressing W to moving forward, pressing left mouse to break blocks.
You can learn vanilla game controls on [corresponding wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Controls#Java_Edition) (ignore the F3 key) or read keybinding settings in game.
Controls provided by this mod are described in mod manual pages: [Camera Controls](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#camera-controls), [Mouse Simulation](/doc/KEYBINDINGS.md#mouse-simulation).

### Finding Trees

You can learn this part with the following resources:

* [The TrueBlindCraft Guide::Episode 1: navigating your world and finding your first Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdDpLoCuWBs&list=PLXcBFfRlLcpiDpULQB3L2aX-AQb4-Atbq&index=1)
* [Minecraft Wiki: Coordinates](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coordinates)
* [Minecraft Wiki: Biome](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome)
* [Minecraft Wiki: Tree](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tree)

Trees are consists of log blocks and leaves blocks, we need log blocks as a resource for crafting.
Although each tree has a straight log block trunk and a canopy made of leaves blocks, the height and shape of the tree is randomly generated; some short trees will have leaves that come down low to the ground and enclose the logs two or three layers (as TrueBlind encounters in his guide episode 2), and some taller trees may have logs which float up high that you can't collect from the ground (they're used to mimic tree branches).
If you are targeting at a tree, you will hear the mod speak log block or leaves block.

How to move your character to find trees?
First make yourself in a proper biome that has trees in it, by spawned after crafting new worlds, or by using `/locate <biome>` and `/tp <coordinates>` commands to find and teleport to it.
Then move around to see if we can encounter a tree.
You can use TrueBlind's "reference point" method to remember a coordinates as a teleport target when you're lost in the world.
From time to time, you can pick up the mouse and move it horizontally (or keep pressing one camera horizontally controlling keys) to turn your head around, or press A D while walking thus you move in a Zig-Zag pattern.
All these actions are to increase the range of the world you are viewing (mod scanning).

Once you find a log block, you can use the [POI Marking feature](/doc/FEATURES.md#poi-marking).
When you are targeting at a log block, press `Ctrl + Y` to mark that log block type, the POI feature will only hint for the log blocks that are around you with sounds, instead of hinting preset POI blocks.
When you no longer want to find trees, press `Ctrl + Alt + Y` to cancel the marking, you don't need to target at the marked target when canceling.

More convenient features for finding surrounding trees will be introduced in the future.

### Commands

You can learn this part with the following resources:

* [Official Tutorials: How to Use Commands in Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-commands)
* [Minecraft Wiki: Commands](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands)

Some commands are very convenient when you're playing single player worlds. You can use them to gain advantages or to improve your game experience.
Remember to turn on `Allow Cheats` option when you create the world).
